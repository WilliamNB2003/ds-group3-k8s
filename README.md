# DS-Group 3
Distributed systems project repo

The project is P1: The leader election algorithm
* We are building UML diagrams over the node setup
* We are developing the bully election algorithm in Python 3
* Then we are developing an improved version with the help of online resources using the same environment

## Overview
- `system.py` 
Contains system test of our bully leader election algorithm
- `NodeComposition.py`
Contains the parent class to the election algorithm implementation, containing route logic, node handilng and node intercommunication logic.
- `node.py` and `nodeComposition.py`
Contains the initial and improved leader election algorithms.
